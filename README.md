# Prime-Spiral-Visualization
This code generates a dynamic visualization of an infinite sequence of prime and non-prime numbers. The visualization is centered around the 0 value and constructs an expanding spiral in a clockwise direction using squares. Prime numbers are depicted by bright red squares, while non-prime numbers are represented by darker red squares within the spiral.
